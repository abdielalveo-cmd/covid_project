# Project name: Cyrodil


NASA COVID APP Challenge

# Where There’s a Link, There’s a Way
Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been a proliferation of websites and portals developed to share resources about the topic. Your challenge is to find innovative ways to present and analyze integrated, real-time information about the environmental factors affecting the spread of COVID-19.


# Summary
Communication about what is happening in the region with the new disease is a little uneven and many media do not agree on the information based on that we have decided to create a site where the information is accurate and reliable, comparing data as recent as possible and from reliable sources. This would help to keep people better informed about COVID-19, as the disease progresses and at the same time that problems or victims has led to disease to issues such as the economy and environment. 

# How We Addressed This Challenge
Little did we know about this contest, thanks to a teacher who inspired us to enter. We chose this challenge because we are confident in our ability and experience to withstand work under pressure. 

 Although we don't have many hardware resources, we tried to use the ones we have at our disposal. Because of the pandemic, getting a good team has not been difficult.
